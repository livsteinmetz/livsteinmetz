    "body": "In response to the pandemic, the Barnes rolled out an online education platform for adults and K-12 students in April 2020. We use AWS Interactive Video Service for the low latency live video feed and Stream for our chat. Everything here was locked into place using React and node.js, deployed via Serverless to AWS Lambda. In collaboration with our incredible Education team, we expanded local partnerships, which tripled the enrollment in online courses for adults, and allowed us to reach 40% more school-age students during the 2020-2021 school year compared to in-person courses in pre-pandemic years. We're continuing to update, maintain, and scale the platform for the 2021-2022 school year with exciting plans in the works for the future of art education.",

This application offers convenient methods for a member to purchase tickets, display their membership card, and see updates from the Barnes via Firebase notifications. This application was spun up in TypeScript on the client and server, and data inside the application is pulled from our third party ticketing vendor ACME, which we built upon as our source of truth. Login was done via SMS authentication with AWS Pinpoint. I completed a redesign of the site in Fall 2021, and we've been able to use this site as the groundwork for other features like membership renewals, with have plans to scale further in future projects.",

A user logs into their Spotify account, and similarly to Spotify Wrapped, a unique “fingerprint” image is generated through an algorithm based upon metrics drawn from user listening trends. Some additional features include a Tinder-style UI to create playlists from recommendations generated from listening data, a comparison page to compare user fingerprints to artist fingerprints, a fingerprint sandbox to dynamically alter the appearance of the fingerprint, and a social media inspired story feature to view and share friend profiles. We did this by implementing JSON Web Tokens and Passport.js with OAuth 2.0 for Facebook/Spotify login and registration. Used MEAN Stac (Mongodb, Express, Angular, Node), Typescript, Adobe Creative Cloud, HTML, and custom SCSS.",
