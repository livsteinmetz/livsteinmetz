            I write code, manage products, play bass, and design interfaces. Some days it feels

          <br />
          <p>
            I move between engineering, product design, and fine arts and culture—sometimes all at
            once. I&apos;ve spent the past five years working at the intersection of design,
            technology, and the arts—helping cultural institutions reimagine how they meet people in
            the digital space. My projects have ranged from mobile AR guides that let a gallery
            unfold in new dimensions, to digital learning platforms built to feel less like software
            and more like discovery, to fresh ways of navigating collections online. The throughline
            is less extraction and transaction, more care and connection. Data-driven and
            human-centered, yes—but culturally and ethically attuned, and joyful too!
            <br />
            <br />
            Though my roots and home base will always be in Philadelphia, remote work, friendships,
            and study have carried me across geographies and communities. I studied Double Bass
            Performance and Engineering Design at Vanderbilt University.
          </p>
          <p>
            I keep circling a few research tracks: how to design AI that protects human agency; what
            digital well-being looks like when attention is the currency; and how narrative, sound,
            and interface can make learning feel like discovery rather than compliance. Recent work
            includes applied studies, prototypes, and literature reviews on human-centered AI,
            learning experience design, and digital culture—shared as short briefs, talks, and
            open-source experiments.
